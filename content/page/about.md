G'day, mate!

I'm Chris, I enjoy Coffee, Game of Thrones and anything that can break the speed of light.

My passion is in Engineering where I have Bachelor of Engineering. I majored in Robotics and Mechatronics and graduated with Honours.

In the last few years I've published a few games, helped build open-source software and run a local film festival. Along the way, I've built flying robots and CnC Machines.

I use my spare time to read, experiment with code and look after my aquatic snail Timmy.
