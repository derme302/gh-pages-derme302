The [Steam Database posted some mock-ups](http://steamdb.info/blog/48/) of what the Steam store will look like with the new theme that is currently in development. Out of curiosity I wanted to know what the whole thing would look like inside the updated client (that is currently available in the beta channel).

All over I think when it's finished it'll be a nice improvement over the current one which is, in my opinion, a little ugly but immeasurably better than what it used to look like.

Blue is in to stay, what do you think?
