![Just 21 Title](/uploads/2014/03/title_beta.png)

Just 21 is a game I started working during the middle of last year as a mobile HTML5 game, however I hit a couple technical difficulties at the time and set the project aside.Â I recently came back and re-worked the project for Android and iOS. At this stage I'm not planning on releasing a HTML5 version, though it certainly is a possibility for the future.

When updating the game I thought that by using the existing codebase I wrote last year would help save time, which in hindsight was a mistake. When I worked on the project last year my goal was to finish it as quickly as possible which meant most of the code was uncommented and had magical properties.

*"Scipt" what was I thinking?*

If I ever see this comment in a project again I might build a time machine, go back in time and drop a brick on the person that wrote it.

The rest of the project went fairly smoothly though, I increased the resolution of the assets, added in an online highscore board and a nice help screen.

You can go get it now on either Android or iOS:
