I decided last week that I needed a tablet to test my upcoming Android app that I've been working on over the last few months. After writing several pro/con lists, I settled on Asus' Nexus 7.

The main reason I decided to go with the Nexus 7 for app development was that it is running the newest version of Android (4.1.1) which is brilliant for testing my app. Being the flagship Google Tablet I expect that it will get all the major revisions of Android almost as they are released.

<br /> When I was looking at tablets in stores, 7&#8243; seemed way to small as my netbook is 11&#8243; and there never seems to be enough room on the screen. Once I'd sat down and used it for a few hours I actually understand why 7&#8243; is so much better than a 10&#8243; iPad or Samsung Galaxy Tab. 7&#8243; means I can hold it in one hand easily, leaving the other free to swipe and tap away.



Weight wasn't something I had considered when looking for a tablet, but it's probably something I should of, weight dictates how many hours you can hold something for until it gets uncomfortable. I have a Kindle Touch with a case which weighs about 500g and I can hold it in one hand for about an hour to an hour and a half until it starts to irritate me, where as I can hold the Nexus 7 (340g) for about two to three hours.



Heat is another thing you probably want to consider, while the Nexus 7 lacks HDMI out, USB ports, ect. I have found though that the tablets I tested got extremely hot near the port areas even when the ports were not being used. Personally I don't like holding a small volcano in my hand, so I'm really impressed how cool the Nexus stays even after a few hours usage.



I only really have two disappointments with the Nexus, first is the lack of support for a SD Card or model with more storage, even with the 16GB model I'm already filling it up fairly fast. The second issue, which isn't major, is the lack of a physical home button. Though this is something that I'm getting used to, I just dislike giving up precious screen real estate.


Overall I would give the Nexus 4 out of 5 hot potatoes and would recommend it to anyone looking to buy a tablet.
