About this time last month I released &#8220;The Glass is Falling&#8221; via the <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=115103698" target="_blank">Steam Workshop</a> and I received some really good feedback about the game. All of this has gone into creating the update which I uploaded yesterday.

  The main points of the update are:

  * New background and sprites
  * Physics Improvements
  * Various Bug Fixes

The HTML5 port of the game is almost ready to be released, I just have to squash one last bug with the Physics engine. I was planning an initially release on CrySet Games, but they have since shut down and I&#8217;m now looking for other places to publish it.

Over the next month or so I&#8217;m going to be getting the game ready for a release on Google Play, I&#8217;m almost ready but I got a few things left to do:

  * Banner ads for the free version of the game
  * Online Highscore integration
  * Help screen included in game
  * Sound effects, though this may have to wait for a later update
