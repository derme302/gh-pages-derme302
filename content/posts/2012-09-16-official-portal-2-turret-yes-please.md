![Portal 2 Sentry Turret Robot](http://derme.coffee/uploads/2012/09/valve-portal-2-sentry-turret-teaser.jpg)

Portal would have to be one of my favourite puzzle games of all time the others being Lemmings and Portal 2.

When Velociraptor proofing my place of dwelling, something I always wanted to include was a couple of Portal turrets, so I'm really hoping that Valve plan to start selling them on the adjacent self to the Weighted Companion Cubes.
