I have not been excited for a video game release for quite some time, but when this was announced I was excited.

When I played the original Homeworld in 1999 I loved it, even though I could never get past the 6<sup>th</sup> mission at the time, it’s a game that’s stuck with me since.

This game with the new engine is simply stunning. The visuals are incredible, the cut scenes are re-mastered and the sound quality is excellent.

Finally Homeworld still has one of the best stories ever delivered in a RTS, it’s hard to describe it without spoilers so I won’t, but I can’t think of another RTS that does the story aspect this well.

An interstellar achievement of a game, thank you Gearbox for bringing it back.
