So today I finally decided to pick up [Hexels](http://hexraystudios.com/hexels/), which is a neat little tool to make minimalistic artwork. However I needed a rotated Hexel for my current project, which needed to be defined via the custom-shape tool. (Thanks to [YellowAfterlife](http://twitter.com/YellowAfterlife) for pointing that feature out)

If you need this for one of your projects you can <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">download it here</span>Â (EDIT 22/5/2014 - Hexels now includes rotated hexels as a preset, you can find it in the custom shape section). Happy Hexeling!
