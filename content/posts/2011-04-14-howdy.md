Its been a while, hasn't it? I've tried to do a blog a few times now, but haven't been able to keep it going. So here goes attempt three!

Alright, onto the good stuff, other than this blog I've been busy working on a very cool new game. It's still early days, but it's shaping up to be interesting.

Currently in the process of increasing the graphics quality, something that was severely lacking in the last game.

Also attempting to add an auto-updater to make it faster to roll out updates, not sure about how feasible it is though.

Finally the last feature I really want to add is an online highscore board. I think by add a layer of competition would be of immense benefit.
